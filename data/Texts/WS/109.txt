    measurement services, analytics and others ( "third party ad companies" ) to display advertising on our Services, and to manage or measure our
    advertising on third party sites, social media platforms, mobile apps and

    permit them to use or share the data we submit with other third-party
    advertisers. Opt out of targeted ads. You may control how
