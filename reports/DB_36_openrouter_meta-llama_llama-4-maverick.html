When you use our Services, as further explained, we collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data directly from the end users, via partners and third-party service providers.

Also, we enrich this information via our technology to deduce additional personal data about you such as your interest segment. In addition, we also receive Personal Data from our advertiser/agency partners as you navigate through their websites once you click their ads. As a general principle, we do not collect, generate and do not ask you to provide any &quot;special categories of Personal Data&quot;, which is any particularly protected information such as data concerning health, religion, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences or orientation.
