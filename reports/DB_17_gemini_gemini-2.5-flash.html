Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our websites about children under age 13. If a child whom we know to be under age 13 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to ours. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third-parties.

Information Third Parties Provide\n\nWe also may collect information about you from sources other than from you directly, such as from social media websites (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), other users and our business partners.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to our privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any Third Parties, even if our ads contain links to Third Party websites and even if we have an independent business relationship with that Third Party. This policy does not address, and we are not responsible for information practices (including collection, usage, disclosure or data security) of any Third Parties, including any Third Party operating any site or service to which our Site links. The inclusion of a link on our Site does not imply our or our affiliates’ endorsement of the linked site or service.\n\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of each and every web site that you visit to be sure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to you from each of them.\n\nSupplementation of Personal Information: In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us with information from Third Party sources. For example:\n\nAddress Verification: If you provide your email address during member registration or otherwise, we use Third Parties in order to verify your email address information registration process.\nEnhancement of Profile Information: We obtain marketing data from Third Parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers for which we think you would be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the Personal Information you submitted to us. If you choose to link any of your social media accounts to your account, you may be given the option to log into your account using the credentials from any such social media accounts. When you choose to use this log-in feature, we may obtain information from all of the social media accounts that you have chosen to link to your account. Such information may include, for example, your name, date of birth, gender, location, profile photo, interests, activities, likes, check-ins, languages, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, professional information, contacts or similar information. You may unlink any of your social media accounts from your account by modifying your account settings. When you do so, we will stop obtaining new information from such social media accounts.\nWhen We Advertise on Third Party Sites: When you visit a site on which we advertise and click through our advertisement, we may place cookies on your computer or use pixel tags. The information that we collect through this technology is not personally identifiable.\nC. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\n\nWe use tracking technologies to help provide content, to measure promotional effectiveness, to offer advertisements and/or other offerings, to recognize you and your preferences when you return to our site, to help us learn more about how our users use our sites, to personalize your experience, to assess which areas of our Site you visit, and to remarket to you after you leave our site.\n\nTracking: We permit Service Providers (as defined below) and Third Parties (as defined below) that we have agreements with us to track you when you are on our Site. When you leave our Site there is a chance that these Third Parties may continue to track you.\n\nA few tracking technologies include, without limitation, images, scripts and subsequent technology and methods later developed:\n\nCookies: Edvisors uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. “Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user and help store your preferences and activity. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors’ Site.\n\nWeb Beacons: Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming which may be included in our Services. Web beacons can be invisible to you and are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate our Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many specific articles or links were actually viewed.\n\nHTML5 and Locally Stored Objects: Similar to cookies are “locally stored objects” which we may also use for storing analytics information. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache. To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.\n\nAnalytics Tools and Third-Party Cookies: Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. We also use Third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit our Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use this information only to improve our Sites and Services. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Site. Third Parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf. By using our Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by a Third-Party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.\n\nFor some of our products, we use Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting,  Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting.\n\nYou may opt out of the Google Analytics service with Google’s Browser Add-on that’s available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/\n\nFor information in general about Google’s remarketing ad campaigns, and specifically about information regarding DoubleClick cookies and how to control and manage Google’s advertising cookies for these campaigns, visit https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.\n\nFor another Google resource for opting out of Google’s use of cookies, visit https://www.google.com/settings/ads/.\n\nFor another resource recommended by Google for opting out of a Third-Party vendor’s use of cookies, visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.\n\nYou can exercise cookie choices by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.\n\nOur Site may also use, on some pages, the HotJar Analysis and Feedback tool. We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device&#x27;s IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.\n\nFor more information see HotJar&#x27;s Privacy Policy at https://www.hotjar.com/privacy.\n\nYou can choose to disable the HotJar service at https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out.\n\nOnline Advertising Networks and Third-Party Cookies: Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our Site and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads”, “online behavioral advertising”, or “targeted advertising”. We hire “ad networks” to display these ads on websites across the Internet. Edvisors adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\n\nThe ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.\n\nThird-party companies may use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on our Site. These technologies may be used directly on our Site. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.\n\nFor more general information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.\n\nCross-device and cross-app technology: We use the term “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile devices, as well as the internet browsers and other applications on your devices that interact with the internet. We and our customers may use technology that establishes deterministic or statistical connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes. This includes cross device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data from separate devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related.\n\nHow We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals: Some web browsers or mobile device operating systems incorporate a “Do Not Track” (a/k/a DNT) feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. We do not respond to web browser and/or mobile device operating systems “Do Not Track” signals at this time.</div>
