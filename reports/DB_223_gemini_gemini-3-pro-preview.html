From Your Internet-Connected Devices\nWhen Providers we work with integrate our technology with their devices, apps, sites or services, we collect the following types of data about you and your device through those partners.\n\nDevice Data. Device data includes details about the device(s) you use, such as its manufacturer; model; registered country code; mobile carrier; operating system and version; crash data (if applicable); and what settings and permissions you’ve enabled. Your device and software settings affect what information your device makes available to us such as the language you prefer to use on your mobile device; mobile applications you install on your device and purchase you make in those mobile applications; bluetooth or wireless preferences; and the like. We may collect this information from mobile devices, internet-connected televisions, desktop and laptop computers, and/or other internet-connected devices.\n\nIdentifiers. We collect identifiers such as mobile advertising IDs, IP addresses, cookies, and other identifiers from your device, and clear or hashed email addresses, names, phone numbers, or other identifiers that you voluntarily provide when you register, checkout, or otherwise enter data into an online or app form.\n\nApp and Site data. We collect information about the specific apps &amp; sites you may use and/or visit on your device(s), such as the names of those apps, sites, and other relevant metadata.\n\nGeolocation Data. We collect location data such as latitude, longitude, and timestamps directly from your device or other sources as mentioned above and from our Providers.\n\nDemographic Data. We collect information such as your age or gender that you voluntarily provide when you register or make a purchase on an app, website, or other such event. In some cases, this may be considered information about “protected classifications” under the CCPA.\n\nInferences. We may draw inferences from the information we collect from mobile devices to create audience segments reflecting consumer preferences and characteristics. Note that some of our data may fall into more than one of the above categories. For example, an IP address is both a unique identifier and device data.\n\nB. From Third Parties and Aggregated Public Sources:\nWe may collect information from public and private sources of aggregated data (e.g. the Apple App Store and the Android Play Store), website crawling, or from other third parties or public sources that we use in providing the VentiveIQ Services:\n\nMetadata about mobile apps\n\nPoint of Interest data such as an identifier for a commercial location and relevant metadata(e.g. a retail store or a coffee shop)\n\nCensus data and other publicly available data sources\n\nOther sources of behavioral, purchase, demographic information, and/or identifiers\n\nC. In Our Corporate Capacity and From our Site\nPeople who visit VentiveIQ’s Site are generally representatives of businesses (such as for our Providers or our clients) that are interested in VentiveIQ’s Services, not individual consumers. When individuals visit our Site, they may choose to provide information to us, such as when they create or log in to their account with us, to contact us to request or provide information, or apply for a job. In addition, when you interact with our Site, we (and third parties) may collect technical information from your browser or device by automated means such as pixels, cookies, web beacons, local storage, JavaScript, API, and other similar technologies. We may also collect this kind of information when you interact with email messages we have sent you. As we and our service providers develop other technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. We may collect the following categories of information from our Site:\n\nFull name\n\nEmail address\n\nPhone number\n\nTerrestrial Address\n\nAccount username and password\n\nProfessional and employment-related information\n\nCookie IDs\n\nInformation about your device and operating system\n\nSystem activity and settings\n\nInformation about your internet connection, including IP address and carrier.\n\nWe may also sometimes collect information through business channels and Events such as trade shows, or through marketing platforms that help us identify new customers.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>Mobile Advertising ID A “mobile advertising ID” or “MAID” is a unique identifier of a mobile device used in the mobile advertising ecosystem. This can be Android’s Ad ID (AAID) or Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).</div></td></tr><tr class=''><td><div class='human-text'>HOW VENTIVEIQ USES THE DATA WE COLLECT\nTo provide the Advertising Services and associated analytics.\n\nTo facilitate research and analysis of consumer habits.\n\nTo make inferences about consumer interests.\n\nTo perform Data Modeling for quality control on our data solutions.\n\nTo establish probable connections among different browsers, devices, and internet identifiers to associate them with the same user or household, and to otherwise create linkages between different data elements (e.g., establishing that a hashed email address is associated with a certain device ID, or that a mailing address is associated with a device ID). For instance, when a user visits or logs in to a website (or engages in a particular type of transaction), we might use the information we collect to help a business send advertising or content to the user across a different channel or device (such as mobile, TV, email or direct mail).\n\nOur internal business purposes such as the development, enhancement, improvement, and release of new products and services. This allows us to create technology products that we license or sell to Customers. These products help our Customers understand their end users better in order to create enhanced experiences for them.\n\nTo maintain and enhance VentiveIQ Services, for example, to debug or research technical issues and resolve them.\n\nTo maintain the security of our systems and to prevent fraud.\n\nWhen users submit contact information to us in connection with an inquiry or request, to verify and respond to those inquiries or requests.\n\nFor legal or regulatory compliance or to assert or protect our rights.\n\nTo create aggregate data (which is not personal information) to run analytics on certain customer segments, advertising campaigns, or other datasets.\n\nTo provide, maintain, and improve the Services (including our website) for VentiveIQ Customers and prospective customers\n\nFor our own advertising and marketing purposes.\n\nFor individuals who apply for jobs through our website, to evaluate them as candidates for employment with VentiveIQ.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>Device Data.

Device data includes details about the device(s) you use, such as its manufacturer; model; registered country code; mobile carrier; operating system and version; crash data (if applicable); and what settings and permissions you’ve enabled. Your device and software settings affect what information your device makes available to us such as the language you prefer to use on your mobile device; mobile applications you install on your device and purchase you make in those mobile applications; bluetooth or wireless preferences; and the like. We may collect this information from mobile devices, internet-connected televisions, desktop and laptop computers, and/or other internet-connected devices.\n\nIdentifiers. We collect identifiers such as mobile advertising IDs, IP addresses, cookies, and other identifiers from your device, and clear or hashed email addresses, names, phone numbers, or other identifiers that you voluntarily provide when you register, checkout, or otherwise enter data into an online or app form.\n\nApp and Site data. We collect information about the specific apps &amp; sites you may use and/or visit on your device(s), such as the names of those apps, sites, and other relevant metadata.\n\nGeolocation Data. We collect location data such as latitude, longitude, and timestamps directly from your device or other sources as mentioned above and from our Providers.\n\nDemographic Data. We collect information such as your age or gender that you voluntarily provide when you register or make a purchase on an app, website, or other such event. In some cases, this may be considered information about “protected classifications” under the CCPA.\n\nInferences. We may draw inferences from the information we collect from mobile devices to create audience segments reflecting consumer preferences and characteristics. Note that some of our data may fall into more than one of the above categories. For example, an IP address is both a unique identifier and device data.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>GEOLOCATION DATA... PURPOSES BEHIND COLLECTION, USE, AND SHARING...
