We may also disclose to these Service Providers your health and travel-related information in order to protect the health and safety of our personnel, clients, guests, and the general public.  Our policy is to inform our Service Providers not to use or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose other than for providing services to us.
We may share your Personal Information with companies that we own or control, or are owned or controlled by (our “Corporate Family”), including health and travel-related information in order to protect the health and safety of our personnel, clients, guests, and the general public.
We may share your Personal Information with companies or individuals outside of BDO USA who may use your Personal Information for their own purposes (a “Third Party”). For example:
Our clients.
If you choose to submit Personal Information through the “Testimonials” link, we may share your Personal Information publicly or with Third Parties.
From time to time, we may be required to provide Personal Information to a Third Party in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law or legal process.
We may share your Personal Information with Third Parties, such as law enforcement agencies, other government agencies, or health authorities (i) when we, in good faith, believe you or others are acting unlawfully, (ii) when we believe it is necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, (iii) to operate our business and Sites properly, (iv) to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our users, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, or (v) we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the health and safety of our personnel, clients, guests, and the general public.
