We may also use service providers to assist us with providing our VentiveIQ Services to Customers or Providers, or to assist us in marketing to our finding new customers. Our service providers are contractually required to use personal information only to provide their service to us, and are contractually prohibited from using or disclosing personal information for their own purposes.\n\nWith your consent: We may share information about you with third parties at your direction or with your consent.\n\nIn Connection with a Financing or Sale of Our Business: If a third party invests in, or acquires, some, or all, of our business or assets, we may disclose your information in connection with the sale (including during due diligence in preparation for the transaction).\n\nIn Connection with Legal Obligations: We may disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; protect your safety or the safety of others; investigate fraud; or respond to a government request. In certain situations, VentiveIQ may also be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities.\n\nWe may share and disclose the information we collect in our corporate capacity in most of the above ways as well: we may share them with our service providers, with consent, in connection with financing or sale, or to exercise our legal obligations.</div>
