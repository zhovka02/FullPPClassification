We use and make available PII for various purposes. For instance,

We help email service providers, brands, and agencies to preemptively identify and score email addresses, email lists, and email senders that may be harmful to their mailing reputations and or those of their customers or users.

Specifically, we provide threat intelligence services such as risk scoring, abuse and fraud prevention services, and other analytic and compliance services as they pertain to email marketing.

We may also use PII to help other data platforms perform cross-channel risk assessments and identity resolution. These platforms may de-identify PII (such as by creating a “hashed” version of an email address, or another associated identifier) in order to identify consumers through other marketing or communication channels.</div>

We use and make available PII for various purposes. For instance,

We help email service providers, brands, and agencies to preemptively identify and score email addresses, email lists, and email senders that may be harmful to their mailing reputations and or those of their customers or users.

Specifically, we provide threat intelligence services such as risk scoring, abuse and fraud prevention services, and other analytic and compliance services as they pertain to email marketing.

We may also use PII to help other data platforms perform cross-channel risk assessments and identity resolution. These platforms may de-identify PII (such as by creating a “hashed” version of an email address, or another associated identifier) in order to identify consumers through other marketing or communication channels.</div>

Indiemark may share data, including PII, as follows:

Clients: We may share data, including PII, with our clients to help us to perform any of the services described in this Privacy Policy. We may do so, for instance, to identify non-compliant email senders, primitively assess the risk or quality of an email address or identify consumers across multiple marketing channels.

Partners: We may share data, including PII, with business and data partners (such as business partners who provide to marketers their own applications or data services) or with clients, to help provide more tailored, analytical or deliverability services.

Corporate Transfers: If Indiemark or its significant assets are purchased by another entity, our data will likely be transferred to that entity, including for due diligence prior to any such potential purchase.

Parents and Subsidiaries: We may share some or all of the data in our possession with affiliated or subsidiary brands.

As Required by Law or to Protect Any Party: We may disclose data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwise defend the rights, property or safety of Indiemark or any other party.</div>
