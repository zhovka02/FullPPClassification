                    <div class="text-content">Tracking Technologies Used\n\nThe technologies that we may use to collect information for our Services include: \n\nCookies. A cookie is information that is stored on a user’s computer or device that can uniquely identify the browser utilized by the user. Cookies may be stored for different periods of time depending on how they are used. “Session cookies” store information that is only relevant for your current activity and are no longer accessible after you shut down your browser. “Persistent cookies” remain after you close your browser and may be accessed by your browser on subsequent visits.\nPixels. A pixel is a piece of code that may be used on a website you visit or email messages that you view or receive,which allows our clients, partners and us to record the types of information specified above (see the section entitled “Data Elements We Collect). Pixels are also known as “web beacons” or “tracking tags.”\nApplication software development kits(SDKs). An SDK is a library of code that is embedded directly in partner applications. We may collect information via an SDK about select user behavior in an application (e.g., when a user opens an application or interacts with that application).\nServer-to-server connections with our partners and clients. We may use a server-to-server connection to collect or exchange information when an SDK integration is not feasible or practical for our partners. \nWe use the tracking technologies listed above across platforms including websites, mobile applications and emails for the purpose of providing our Services.  Examples of how we deploy these technologies include: (1) when an ad is delivered and (2) when we integrate with our partners’ websites, newsletters and applications.  \n\nWe do not use “zombie cookies” or “history sniffing.” We do not use local storage and flash cookies.</div>
