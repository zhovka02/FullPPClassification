Verification Process and Required Information. Please note that in order to exercise your rights for information and/or deletion, we may take reasonable steps to verify the identity of a consumer making the request.

We request that our affidavit be notarized and returned to us (as described in instructions that will be provided upon submission request). Belardi Wong will compensate for the reasonable cost of this notarization.

In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the right to know and/or right to deletion, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or if an exception applies.

Authorized Agent. You may designate an authorized agent to make a CCPA request on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests, or a power of attorney. We may also follow up to verify your identity by requesting a notarized affidavit before processing the authorized agent’s request.</div>
