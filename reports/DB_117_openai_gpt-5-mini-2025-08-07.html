                    <div class='match-info'><b>Matched GT:</b> Hivestack is a leading advertising company that provides a technology platform which gives marketers a powerful solution to deliver digital out-of-home (“DOOH”) advertising campaigns. Hivestack has developed a proprietary technology platform that enables clients to reach their desired target audience, and measure the efficacy of their campaigns.\n\nHivestack partners with location data provider companies who collect and use precise location data to help advertisers provide more relevant offers to mobile application users, and to inform the delivery and measurement of DOOH advertising. Hivestack does not collect this location data directly; all location Information is provided by Hivestack’s partners, such as Cuebiq who are one of our data providers.\n\nHivestack receives this location Information from its partners as a file in a secure AWS S3 transfer. This location Information includes lat/long (latitudinal and longitudinal) data, i.e., GPS-level data associated with a mobile advertising ID, such as an IDFA or an Google Android Advertising ID (“GAAID”) and time and date Information as a timestamp.\n\nWe use the Information we receive to understand the optimal times and locations to best reach defined audiences on DOOH screens. This allows Hivestack to deliver ads to DOOH screens and to understand movement patterns.\n\nThe location data we receive is also used to understand which mobile Device IDs (IDFA and GAAID) were in proximity to a DOOH location at a time when DOOH campaign creative was displayed and build a list of those Device IDs. That list of mobile Device IDs in proximity to DOOH locations, may then be used to build an audience for targeting delivery of mobile in-app advertisements. These Mobile Advertising IDs can be used for certain advertising purposes. They can be used to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same Device, track a Device to show that the Device interacted with an ad (i.e. “clicked” on it, watched a video ad, or downloaded an application as a result of an advertisement).\n\nHivestack does not permit any data collected to be used for Personalized Advertising relating to sensitive health segments, or sexual orientation.\n\nThis location Information we receive from our partners may additionally be used to perform aggregated “attribution” analysis for DOOH campaigns. This analysis can help marketers understand in aggregate which users have been exposed to which DOOH ad campaigns and if Devices exposed to a DOOH advertising were then measured at that advertiser’s physical retail location. This is done so that an ad campaign’s success may be understood.</div>

For iOS mobile Devices, go to “Settings” from your Device’s home screen; scroll down to “Privacy”; select “Advertising”; and turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.” For Android mobile Devices, go to “Google Settings” on your Device; select “Ads”; and check the box labeled “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads.” Our data partners honour these “limit” or “opt out” instructions or “flags” by removing recognized Devices from our cross-app advertising or ad delivery and reporting solutions, on a going-forward basis. You may opt out of certain advertisers’ cookies and browser-enabled, interest-based advertising by visiting Network Advertising Initiative Mobile Choice page. Please note that these opt outs apply to interest-based advertising by participating advertisers. You may still receive other types of online advertising from participating advertisers, and the websites you visit may still collect Information for other purposes. In addition, the opt-out choices you select are stored in opt-out cookies only in the browser that you use to visit the opt-out websites, so you should separately set your preferences for other browsers or Devices you may use.
