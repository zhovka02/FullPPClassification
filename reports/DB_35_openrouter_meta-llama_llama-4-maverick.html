                    <div class="text-content">Information About You.
The information that you provide directly to us and that we obtain from others is what we need to serve you, our affiliates and business customers. This information may include your contact details (such as name, postal and email addresses, phone number, social media handles and other online aliases); information specific to the Service you request (such as financial information when you apply for credit); details about your vehicle (such as performance and location information) and Dealer transactions (including phone calls, chat transcripts, and other details); contact information of individuals with whom you would like to share FordDirect content; social media information; demographic and household information; your responses and engagement with our Services; and other information you may choose to share with us by interacting with our Services or with our affiliates, business customers, suppliers or other businesses that share information with us.

Information About Your Device.
The information we collect by automated means also helps us, our affiliates and our business customers to provide and tailor various products and services. Examples of information we collect by automated means include the following:

Usage Information.
We and our suppliers may automatically collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details (such as your IP address and browser type), as well the ID and type of the device you use to connect or interact with our Services, and other details about your use or interaction with our Services. This may also include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services and across devices that you use.

FordDirect does not itself respond to web browser-based do-not-track signals since there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the do-not-track signal.

Location Data.
Some of our Services may collect imprecise geo-location data to provide or improve our Services and location-related functionality, such as the location of your nearest Dealer, and your imprecise location while at a Dealer or near a Dealer’s location. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you.</div>

                    <div class="text-content">Information You Provide.
We and our suppliers collect the information you voluntarily provide to us in connection with using our Services, including through product inquiries (including phone calls, chat transcripts, and other details), requests for vehicle information, financing requests, technical services or questions, product registration and support, events and promotions, job applications, other inquiries and transactions. Our suppliers also may collect information from you, including, for example, when you participate in our contests, sweepstakes, surveys, and other promotions. Some portions of the Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content.

Information We Obtain from Affiliates, Business Customers, Suppliers and Others.
We may obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, our affiliates, Dealers, and Dealer Associations that deploy FordDirect products and Services and suppliers may share with us certain information you provided to them or collected by using their website. They may also inform us whether you have been approved for credit and related information. We also may obtain demographic, user preferences, geo-location and other information about you from other parties. If you engage via social media with us, our affiliates, our business customers, or our suppliers, the social media platforms also may share certain information with FordDirect. You may be able to adjust your social media privacy settings to limit the sharing of your social media data.

Information We Obtain by Automated Means.
We may collect information about your use or interaction with our Services or about the devices you use to connect or interact with the Services by automated means, including tracking technologies. These tracking technologies may include “cookies,” which are small lines of text/data that are written onto your device by a website. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly. FordDirect and suppliers acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, beacons, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi monitoring and other technologies to operate the Services. Cookies we may use may redirect you to other websites. With your consent, we may also use video technologies to capture your demographic information and engagement with our Services in order to present you with a more personalized experience.</div>

Our Services may include third-party advertising, promotions, co-branded features, links to other websites, and other programs offered by or in collaboration with third-party businesses, such as Adobe, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. These third party-businesses may collect information from you when you interact directly with them or through their tracking technologies on our Services. Information may be collected about you across time and services and associated with the various devices you use. This information may be used for analytics, advertising, and marketing purposes, including to measure the effectiveness of ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track users who click on the links made available through the Services. For example, we incorporate the Bing Universal Event Tracking (UET) pixel from Microsoft Bing Ads on our website, which is used for user tracking and data sharing with third parties for advertising and marketing purposes, and to measure ad effectiveness.

Within FordDirect.
FordDirect may authorize access to your information within our enterprise, by our employees and other personnel, to fulfill our obligations to you and to operate our business.

Affiliates, Dealers, and Dealer Associations.
Our affiliates, Dealers, and Dealer Associations may access and use your information for the purposes we describe in this Privacy Statement. We may also allow our affiliates, Dealers, and Dealer Associations to have access to your information and to use aggregate statistics – statistics not linked by us to any specific consumer – about consumer behavior, sales, online activity patterns, and related Services information. Except as necessary to provide you with the Services, we will not provide our affiliates with personal financial information that we obtain when you use the Services to submit a request for credit.

All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent, which we receive from FordDirect employees, contractors, and or Dealer contacts. Such data will not be shared with any third parties, provided that the foregoing does not apply to sharing (1) with suppliers, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf (and who will not use such information for their own purposes); (2) if when we believe disclosure is required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation or to comply with law enforcement or legal process; and or (3) when if the user consents to our sharing of such information.

Suppliers.
We disclose personal information to suppliers working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, including as necessary to provide functionality, products, and services to us and you in connection with the Services. FordDirect requires suppliers to process your information under the direction of FordDirect and in accordance with contractual restrictions and applicable law.

Marketing Partners.
We may share your information with our marketing partners when, for example, we participate in a co-branded promotion with another company. Other than as described in this Privacy Statement, we will not share your information with suppliers for their own marketing purposes. Except as necessary to provide you with the Services, we also will not provide our marketing partners with personal financial information that we obtain when you use the Services to submit a request for credit.

Analytics and Advertising.
We may share your information, including data collected through cookies and similar technology, with third-party businesses for analytics and advertising related purposes. Third-party businesses may act as our suppliers, or in many contexts, independently decide how to process your information. Please see the “Data Collection and Use by Third Parties” section for a description of how we work with third-party businesses.

Your Public Comments.
Some portions of our Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content. This content may be displayed on the Services and may be viewable by other users of the Services or the public generally.

Mergers, Acquisitions or Insolvency.
If FordDirect should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if FordDirect should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, FordDirect reserves the right to disclose your information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.

As Required by Law and Other Disclosures.
FordDirect may be required to disclose your information if it:

believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority;
would potentially lessen our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit or investigation; or
is necessary to protect our or others&#x27; rights or property.</div>
