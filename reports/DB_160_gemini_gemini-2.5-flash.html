A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.</div>
