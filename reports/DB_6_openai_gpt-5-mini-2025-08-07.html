The Website uses “cookies” and other web tracking tools to enhance your online experience with us. We may store information about you using the cookies on our website. A cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user’s computer by the user’s web browser while the user is browsing. We use cookies to improve your site experience, to assess content usage, to distinguish you from other users of our site and to support the marketing of our services. For example, cookies help determine what kind of content we will serve to the user – a use case might be, if a user is browsing a particular set of page content themes, we might serve that theme in the form of advertising as we’ve identified them as an interested party of that theme.</div></td><td class='empty-cell'>Not Extracted by LLM</td><td style='text-align:center;'>FN</td></tr><tr class='fn'><td><div class='human-text'>3.2 GIFs. We or our service providers may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” “embedded links” and other commonly-used information-gathering tools in connection with some website pages and HTML-formatted email messages. We use these tools for such purposes as compiling aggregate statistics about website usage and response rates. A pixel tag is an electronic image (often a single pixel), that is ordinarily not visible to website visitors, and may be associated with cookies on visitors’ hard drives. Pixel tags allow us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver customized services, and to help determine the effectiveness of the Website and services. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, pixel tags can inform the sender of the email whether and when the email has been opened.</div></td><td class='empty-cell'>Not Extracted by LLM</td><td style='text-align:center;'>FN</td></tr><tr class='fn'><td><div class='human-text'>3.3 Clickstreams. As you use the Internet, you leave a trail of electronic information at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;clickstream data”, can be collected and stored by a website&#x27;s server. Clickstream data can reveal the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the website. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personal information to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Website, how visitors navigate through the Website, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. We will only use this information to improve the Website.</div></td><td class='empty-cell'>Not Extracted by LLM</td><td style='text-align:center;'>FN</td></tr><tr class='fn'><td><div class='human-text'>3.4 Advertising. Note that we may use cookies and other technologies for purposes of on-line advertising. This means that when you use the services, we or third-party ad servers, ad network providers or advertisers (collectively “Ad Providers”) may use cookies that they collect or that we provide to them. Such Ad Providers may collect information about your use of the services (including mobile applications) or your online activities over time and across different websites and devices. Collected information may include the content you viewed, the date and time that you viewed this content, and the website that referred you to the services. This information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier or IP address. Ad Providers may provide you with advertisements that you may see on the services or on affiliated websites. To improve the relevancy and help measure the effectiveness of such advertisements, the Ad Providers may use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs or similar technologies. These practices help tailor advertisements that are relevant and of use to you. You may control or opt-out of such advertising by changing the cookie settings in your browser as described above.</div></td><td class='empty-cell'>Not Extracted by LLM</td><td style='text-align:center;'>FN</td></tr><tr class='fn'><td><div class='human-text'>3.5 User Behavior Tracking. We may track the webpages and links our users visit within the Website, in order to determine what services are most popular. We may use such tracking data to deliver customized content and advertising to users whose behavior indicates they are interested in a particular subject area. We may also collect user data to track the areas of a webpage where users most frequently move the mouse or click. These tracking activities make it possible to monitor and analyze web traffic and evaluate user behavior to customize our services.</div></td><td class='empty-cell'>Not Extracted by LLM</td><td style='text-align:center;'>FN</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed</h2><table><thead><tr><th class='human-col'>Human Ground Truth</th><th class='llm-col'>LLM Prediction</th><th class='score-col'>Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='match'><td><div class='human-text'>We may share anonymous, deidentified aggregate information with third parties, including affiliated and non-affiliated organizations such as advertisers.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>We may share anonymous, deidentified aggregate information with third parties, including affiliated and non-affiliated organizations such as advertisers.</div></td><td style='text-align:center;'><span class='score-badge score-high'>1.00</span></td></tr><tr class='miss'><td><div class='human-text'>We may share anonymous, deidentified aggregate information with third parties, including affiliated and non-affiliated organizations such as advertisers.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>Such Ad Providers may collect information about your use of the services (including mobile applications) or your online activities over time and across different websites and devices.</div></td><td style='text-align:center;'><span class='score-badge score-low'>0.14</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Categories of Personal Information Sold</h2><table><thead><tr><th class='human-col'>Human Ground Truth</th><th class='llm-col'>LLM Prediction</th><th class='score-col'>Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='match'><td><div class='human-text'>We do not sell your personal information.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>We do not sell any personal information.</div></td><td style='text-align:center;'><span class='score-badge score-high'>0.86</span></td></tr><tr class='match'><td><div class='human-text'>We do not sell your personal information.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>We do not sell your personal information.</div></td><td style='text-align:center;'><span class='score-badge score-high'>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Description of Right to Delete</h2><table><thead><tr><th class='human-col'>Human Ground Truth</th><th class='llm-col'>LLM Prediction</th><th class='score-col'>Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='match'><td><div class='human-text'>You have the right to request that we delete certain of your personal information that we collected from and/or related to you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>You have the right to request that we delete certain of your personal information that we collected from and/or related to you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.</div></td><td style='text-align:center;'><span class='score-badge score-high'>1.00</span></td></tr><tr class='match'><td><div class='human-text'>To the extent that we can delete your personal information, once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information, unless an exception applies.</div></td><td><div class='llm-text'>To the extent that we can delete your personal information, once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information, unless an exception applies.</div></td><td style='text-align:center;'><span class='score-badge score-high'>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Description of Right to Know PI Collected</h2><table><thead><tr><th class='human-col'>Human Ground Truth</th><th class='llm-col'>LLM Prediction</th><th class='score-col'>Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='match'><td><div class='human-text'>California residents have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months.
